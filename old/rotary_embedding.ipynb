An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or \"spontaneous abortion\"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.
